== Google Contacts API

Fetch user's contact list from your web application without asking him to
provide his password.

First, make users follow this URL:

  Contacts::Gmail.authentication_url('http://mysite.com/invite')

They will authenticate on Google and it will send them back to the URL provided. Google will add a token GET parameter to the query part of the URL. Use that token in the next step:

  gmail = Contacts::Gmail.new('example@gmail.com', params[:token])
  contacts = gmail.contacts

== Specdoc

Contacts::Gmail.authentication_url
- generates a URL for target with default parameters
- should handle boolean parameters

Contacts::Gmail
- is ready to query contacts from a specific account
- fetches contacts feed via HTTP GET
- handles gzipped response
- raises a FetchingError when something goes awry
- parses the resulting feed into name/email pairs
- makes modification time available after parsing
